# DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEW GAMES
# =============================================================================
#
# Each game in the games/ directory should be deployed as a separate Vercel project.
#
# To deploy a new game:
#
# 1. Create a new Vercel project for the game:
#    cd games/space-invaders
#    vercel
#
# 2. Note the deployment URL (e.g., https://cabspaceinvaders.vercel.app)
#
# 3. Add the game to GAMES_CONFIG in your cabinet's Vercel environment variables
#
# Games to deploy:
# - games/pong           -> cabpong.vercel.app
# - games/breakout       -> cabbreakout.vercel.app
# - games/flappybird     -> cabflappybird.vercel.app
# - games/tetris         -> cabtetris.vercel.app
# - games/pacman         -> cabpacman.vercel.app

# - games/blackjack      -> cabblackjack.vercel.app

#
# For local development, run `pnpm run cabinet` from the root directory.
